# **Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis**

### **Purpose**
Driven by the initial findings from the headcount analysis at Pewlett-Hackard (PH), the following document will dive a little deeper into the senior employees data so that the company may launch a mentoring program to further prepare for the upcomming "retirement wave" on PH.
#

## **Results**
As originaly encountered, the analysis has confirmed that there is indeed a really high risk of a _"silver tsunami"_ as currently refered to. 
However, this deepdive found an important number of eligible candidates for the proposed mentoring program.

In summary, the main conclussions are:

1. 30% of the total PH headcount is considered as part of the retiring-age* group.
2. Almost 60k employees from the retiring-age cohort have a senior title.</br>
_Retiring-age employees by title:_

3. The pilot program of mentoring could have a total of 1.5k candidates based on the eligibility criteria**.
4. More than 1k employees from this candiates are currently in a senior possition.</br>
_Mentorship eligibility:_

_* Retiring age: employees who are born between January 1, 1952 and December 31._</br>
_** Eligibility criteria: employees who are born between January 1, 1965 and December 31, 1965._
 
#
## **Final Summary and recommendations:**
* More than 90k roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact.
* At least 1k employees have enough qualifications to fullfill a role of mentoring other employees which should be enough the mitigate a second wave of retiring-age employees.
* A deeper analysis could be usefull to provide further insights into the PH headcount problems:
    * A employee-tenure should be made as a second element to the eligibility criteria.
    * A retiring-age and salaries query could help to develop some financial estimations to the hc issue.
